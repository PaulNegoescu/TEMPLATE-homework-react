# React Homework

Using json-server like we did in class, you have the Star Wars API db at your disposal. json-server is already installed and you have a script to start it.

You will not get any hints to help with implementing this homework!

## Requirements

1. Implement a Film list using the films from the DB
   1. List the films as a grid of cards
   2. Style the cards so that they are in a grid of 3 columns
   3. Use the CSS Modules technique we learned in class
   4. Use clsx where necessary, note that it is not installed!

## Bonus Requirements

1. Implement an Add Film component, put it below the list of films
   1. This should be the same kind of form as in the previous homework
   2. Implement the add functionality so that the Film gets added to the db.json file and the grid is updated at the same timne
   3. Remember, no page reloads!
2. Implement the delete functionality for Films, just a button on the film card, use confirm to confirm the delete action
